# Spotify Pocket (Winamp alike)

Spotify minimalist player.

This app idea came to me after getting annoyed with the original Spotify App, which is slow and renders too many useless things on the screen. When I was younger I used Winamp, which was a simple app that just shown our songs and played it. 

Also I used this app to improve my skills in Rust and React. 

## Tools:
- Rust (back-end) 
    - Tauri 2.0
    - Reqwest
    - Axum
    - Tokio
 
- React (front-end)
    - TypeScript
    - Spotify API
    - Spotify SDK
    - React Router
